JAVA

TreeSet implements Set, NavigableSet
NavigableSet extends SortedSet
HASH -> Order not guaranteed
LINKED -> Natural order
TREE -> ASCENDING order
Set, Queue, Stack extend Collection
Map doesnâ€™t extend Collection
HashMap allows a key with null value
PriorityQueue -> Retains the order
BlockingQueue -> Wait till element in queue becomes available; wait can be infinite, or we can mention the waiting period

Thread States > NEW, RUNNABLE, RUNNING, WAITING/BLOCKED, TERMINATED/DEAD
Default Priority: 5
Priority varies: 1 (MIN) to 10 (MAX)
ExecutorService: Executes tasks asynchronously in background. It is similar to thread pool.
A thread can return a value by call method of Callable functional interface.
thread3.join() -> Wait till thread 3 completes execution before proceeding to next line.
thread3.join(2000) -> Wait 2 sec on thread 3 to complete execution before proceeding to next line.
Thread vs Runnable > Extend Thread class only if we are using complete functionality of thread class
yield(): It gives chance to other threads to complete the task
sleep vs wait:
sleep will not return resources before going to blocked states.
wait will get into RUNNABLE state until notify() is called
